German Credit Dataset — Initial Observation Notes

 File downloaded from UCI ML Repository (numeric version).
 Contains 1000 rows and 21 columns (20 features + 1 target).
 Data is space-separated, not comma-separated.
 All columns are numeric-encoded categories or numeric values.
 The last column appears to be the target:

1 = good credit

2 = bad credit / risk of default
 No column names are included in the raw file — they must be added manually later using UCI documentation.
 Suitable for Week 1: EDA, cleaning, and conversion to proper CSV.
